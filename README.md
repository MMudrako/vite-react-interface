# vite-react-interface
based on LinkedIn course react-interface-2880067

This project is a recreation of the Appointment Setting Project originally built using CRACO. In order to modernize and simplify the setup, I decided to start fresh with Vite instead of continuing with the CRACO-based structure. As a result, Iâ€™ve created a completely new repository to build the project with Vite from scratch, using the tutorial as a guide. This approach allows for a more streamlined development experience and better performance, while keeping the structure flexible and up-to-date.
